# my-warhammer-hobby
A simple static webpage that I created for a Hyperion bootcamp project to show off my Warhammer hobby.

I mostly used my original webpage and styling with css as I first made it, however, I reformatted it with bootstrap as I have learnt the skill since then and have been enjoying using it for styling.
